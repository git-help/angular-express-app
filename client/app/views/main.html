      We wanted to provide a real-time service for people to ask questions and receive help from the community. There would be a relatively simple 'Question' (post) entry screen. A user would enter key data such as, the problem files, or entire repo, the last working commit and any additional files required for the project to run. Then a community member would respond either in real-time via chat, or as an 'Answer' (post) Each answer would use Code Mirrors merge mode to present the original code along-side the proposed changes.
    </p>

      Ideally the answer could then be 'automatically' merged into the original repo using the [Nodegit](http://www.nodegit.org/) API.
